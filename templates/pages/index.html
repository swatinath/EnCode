            <h4>What is a blog?</h4>
            <p class="lead fw-normal pt-2">First, let's go over a brief history -- in 1994, Swarthmore College student Justin Hall is credited with the creation of the first blog, Links.net.

The term "weblog" was shortened to "blog" in 1999, by programmer Peter Merholz. <br>
